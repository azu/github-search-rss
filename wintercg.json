In contrast node's crypto APIs provide you with <code class=\"notranslate\">.copy()</code> method on a hasher so you can continue writing into hasher.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Perhaps something along the same lines could be done here as well, e.g. instead of hashing / signing / verifying readable stream, one could create hasher / signer / verifier instance from readable stream, with a method method <code class=\"notranslate\">digest</code> / <code class=\"notranslate\">sign</code> / <code class=\"notranslate\">verify</code> to compute result for the bytes that had been written so far.</p>",

However, this solution is incomplete.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Since the Minimum Common API specification can change overtime, discrepancies can form between frameworks and packages that both claim to be compliant with the standard. For example, consider ECMAScript. When a developer uses ES2020 features in their code, but the target system can only handle ES6 code, their project simply wont work. To parallel that to the Minimum Common API, imagine if the standard was to change and add a new interface. A developer then uses that new interface in their project, and expects to be able to run their project on any framework that indicates its <code class=\"notranslate\">\"wintercg\"</code> compatible. Lets assume a framework hasn't been able to add that new interface yet. This developer's project will not work in that particular framework.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There are plenty more examples to demonstrate how \"wintercg\" key alone is insufficient, but lets move on to a better solution proposal</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There are multiple pieces to this problem</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>How can frameworks reliably indicate they comply with the Minimum Common API?</li>\n<li>How can a library or application author indicate their thing is compatible with any framework that complies with the Minimum Common API?</li>\n<li>How can tools check at build-time and run-time that a given library or application is compatible with current framework?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How can frameworks reliably indicate they comply with the Minimum Common API?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Browser have had a solution to this for a long time, web platform tests. If we create a similar test suite for the Minimum Common API (and maybe even use the existing WPT), frameworks can automatically test themselves against it and report the results to a public tool such as <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">caniuse.com</a>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How can a library or application author indicate their thing is compatible with any framework that complies with the Minimum Common API?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Given the usage example in the Runtime Keys specification, libraries and applications can use the <code class=\"notranslate\">\"engines\"</code> fields in <code class=\"notranslate\">package.json</code> to indicate what framework version (or version range) they can be used in. By introducing a <code class=\"notranslate\">\"wintercg\"</code> key as well as <strong>versioning methodology</strong> for that represents compliance with the Minimum Common API, projects could specify exactly what version of the specification they are compliant with.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How can tools check at build-time and run-time that a given library or application is compatible with current framework?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Incorporating the <strong>versioning methodology</strong> into the test suite compliance tool, build-time and run-time tooling can be instrumented to compare values between what specified in a project’s configuration file (like <code class=\"notranslate\">package.json</code>) with what has been publicly recorded and verify if the given project is supported.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Versioning Methodology</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This part of the proposal is where I believe much of the debate will be. Two options are provided to start the discussion. Please feel free to provide more options for consideration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Option 1</strong>: Annual versioning</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Works like ECMAScript</li>\n<li>At the beginning of the year, we release “WinterCG Minimum Common API ”, for example “WinterCG Minimum Common API 2023”</li>\n<li>Throughout the remainder of the year, changes are added to a “next” version of the spec.</li>\n<li>Keys could look like <code class=\"notranslate\">wintercg-2023</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">wintercg-next</code></li>\n<li>But when used in something like <code class=\"notranslate\">engines</code>, they may be used like <code class=\"notranslate\">\"wintercg\": \"2023\"</code> instead</li>\n<li>For 2023 specifically, we would work to solidify and release the current spec as. And then we’d start the annual release format starting in 2024.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Option 2:</strong> semver</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Works like many of the frameworks do</li>\n<li>Breaking changes are included in Major versions</li>\n<li>New features are included in Minor versions</li>\n<li>Fixes are included in Patch versions</li>\n<li>Keys could look like <code class=\"notranslate\">wintercg-1.0.0</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">wintercg-2.3.4</code></li>\n<li>Similar to annual model, they keys could also be used like <code class=\"notranslate\">\"wintercg\": \"1.0.0\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Next Steps</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Thank you for reading this proposal. Please comment your thoughts and feedback in this issue thread or in the WinterCG Matrix channel. We will discuss this proposal at the next WinterCG call on May 4th, 2023. It will also be presented during my talk at Open Source Summit on May 10th. 🚀</p>",

After all, it's equally \"subtle\" as that function, and people should be careful not to use unauthenticated algorithms by themselves, for example. So I think having some indication of that in the name (e.g. <code class=\"notranslate\">crypto.subtle.EncryptionStream</code>) would be good.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Also, without necessarily advocating for doing so, if we ever want to add <code class=\"notranslate\">DecryptionStream</code>, that would be even more \"subtle\" (since you have to be careful not to accidentally use unauthenticated data), so that should definitely have to live under <code class=\"notranslate\">SubtleCrypto</code>, IMO.</p>",
