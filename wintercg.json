Then i just use a simple logic function that are very similar to <code class=\"notranslate\">console.assert</code> but it throws instead. then i simply just write a for loop to exec all functions, if the env match Deno then i use <code class=\"notranslate\">Deno.test</code> otherwise it have just been a classic for loop that execute. very simple and fast but lose a lot of shiny features for the cost of being more cross compatible. I'm not such a huge fan of any of the existing test framework that exist out there on npm atm.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">now i found out that NodeJS also have a test <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/test.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">runner built in</a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">it would be nice if both could play ball and work the same way...<br>\nI know this isn't something web related but it would be nice if i could write test cases the same way.<br>\nWould even wish for there to be some browserified version of it too.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Bonus point if there where something like <code class=\"notranslate\">node --test --browsers</code> that could launch maybe a headless browser or where i could open up a own browser and navigate to url to hook it in.</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>then it would dump everything to the console,</li>\n<li>talk with each other over websocket</li>\n<li>hook it into file changes</li>\n<li>have some good CI/CD that could execute all test cases in a browser and exit with either an error or a success in the terminal</li>\n</ul>",

I've had many discussions with multiple folks and I have arrived at two options for us. I'd like us to decide on one of them as the organization structure for our specification. Once agreed; I will continue <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1371464266\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/wintercg/fetch/issues/11\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/wintercg/fetch/pull/11/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/wintercg/fetch/pull/11\">#11</a> and get our base line specification published.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Option 1</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The first option is to create a fork of <code class=\"notranslate\">whatwg/fetch</code> here in wintercg. We will utilize aspects of the <a href=\"https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bikeshed</a> language (which is what <code class=\"notranslate\">whatwg/fetch</code> is written in) to omit sections and include notes/extensions for aspects that we want to modify.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We will be responsible for rebasing our modifications every time Fetch lands a change to the specification. This could be partially automated where we create a bot that watches the <code class=\"notranslate\">whatwg/fetch</code> repo, and anytime new commit(s) are merged to <code class=\"notranslate\">main</code>, it would open a branch and attempts to do the necessary git operations. Of course, if there are merge conflicts they would need to be settled by a contributor here in WinterCG.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This will ensure our specification is always up to date with the latest whatwg version.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This option has a long-term maintenance cost where members of WinterCG would be responsible for managing the rebasing overtime. As stated, it could be automated, but it wouldn't be a perfect solution as whenever conflicts arise someone would have to spend time fixing them.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Option 2</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The second option is to start with essentially an empty specification that states something along the lines of: \"Unless otherwise specified in this document, WinterCG Fetch is compatible with the latest edition of WHATWG Fetch specification\". Then, overtime as we agree on modifications to <code class=\"notranslate\">whatwg/fetch</code>, we will create new sections within our document that states the necessary changes. For example, lets pretend we agree to get rid of the entire concept of \"Forbidden Headers\". Our specification may include a section such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Please note this is purely for demonstration purposes. The WinterCG has made no decisions regarding modifications to the Whatwg Fetch API and the content in the following example is purely hypothetical. Do not use this issue thread to discuss the nuance of the example.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"### Headers\n\n#### Modification of Forbidden Headers List\n\nSection [2.2.2 Headers #forbidden-header-name](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-header-name) of the whatwg/fetch specification states a list of header names that are considered &quot;forbidden&quot;. During runtime execution of the Fetch API, usage of a forbidden header results in an early return such as in the [Concept Headers append](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-headers-append) section.\n\nWinterCG Fetch deviates from this section by stating that there are **no** forbidden headers. A WinterCG Fetch API will not return early if it encounters one of these headers.\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">### Headers\n\n#### Modification of Forbidden Headers List\n\nSection [2.2.2 Headers #forbidden-header-name](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-header-name) of the whatwg/fetch specification states a list of header names that are considered \"forbidden\". During runtime execution of the Fetch API, usage of a forbidden header results in an early return such as in the [Concept Headers append](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-headers-append) section.\n\nWinterCG Fetch deviates from this section by stating that there are **no** forbidden headers. A WinterCG Fetch API will not return early if it encounters one of these headers.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This option has less maintenance burden as it could essentially stagnate while remaining \"up to date\". With the catch all statement stating that essentially WinterCG Fetch <strong>is</strong> WHATWG Fetch unless otherwise noted. The WHATWG Fetch could land changes and unless we need to deviate from those changes, we don't have to modify our specification.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Unfortunately, this also means that if we are not on top of changes to WHATWG Fetch, we could incorrectly be supporting something they add that we want to deviate from. Arguably, implementations don't generally move as quickly as standards. And so even if there is a bit of a lag between us coming to decision on a hypothetical change to WHATWG Fetch, many implementers would already be apart of the conversation and it wouldn't have much impact.</p>\n<hr>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With these two options, please react to this post with which one you prefer more to give us a sense of what folks are preferring. We will also be discussing this at upcoming wintercg calls. When we come to a majority decision I will create the initial proposal draft. In the mean time, we can being making API decisions for WinterCG Fetch - capture the result in issues, and when we eventually get our proposal created, I can add those decisions to the initial draft. Also please feel free to use this issue to discuss details of either option too.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Thank you!</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Option 1 - react with: <g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"smile\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png\">😄</g-emoji></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Option 2 - react with: <g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"rocket\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png\">🚀</g-emoji></p>",

The how and when to retry is not important here.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For example, a <code class=\"notranslate\">fetch()</code> promise can fail for many reasons.

That reason might be that another <code class=\"notranslate\">Error</code> was thrown, or it might be that some other condition occurred. For instance, the network was down, or there was an internal error, etc. So let's differentiate between <code class=\"notranslate\">Error</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">Condition</code>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">If I have a transient condition and want to communicate that the user should retry their operation, then I could logically do something like:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"cont condition = {\n  // The condition is temporary....\n  transient: true,\n  // The operation is retriable...\n  retriable: true,\n};\nconst err = new Error('oops that failed', { cause: condition });\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><span class=\"pl-s1\">cont</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">condition</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c\">// The condition is temporary....</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c1\">transient</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">true</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c\">// The operation is retriable...</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c1\">retriable</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">true</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">const</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">err</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">new</span> <span class=\"pl-v\">Error</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'oops that failed'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">cause</span>: <span class=\"pl-s1\">condition</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The challenge with this, of course, is interoperability. If workers chooses to use <code class=\"notranslate\">cause</code> in this way but other <code class=\"notranslate\">fetch()</code> implementations choose to use <code class=\"notranslate\">cause</code> in other ways then we can run into interop issues. To be clear, <em>ALL</em> of the options suffer from this exact problem.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Proposal</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The proposal I would like to make is to define a new <code class=\"notranslate\">ErrorCondition</code> interface specifically for use with <code class=\"notranslate\">cause</code></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Essentially (treat this as a discussion example to express intent... the <em>actual</em> proposal can be refined):</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"dictionary ErrorConditionInit {\n  boolean transient = false;\n  boolean retriable = false;\n  DOMString name = &quot;&quot;;\n};\n\ninterface ErrorCondition {\n  constructor(optional DOMString message = &quot;&quot;, optional ConditionInit init = {});\n  readonly attribute boolean transient;\n  readonly attribute boolean retriable;\n  readonly attribute DOMString name;\n  readonly attribute DOMString message;\n}\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">dictionary ErrorConditionInit {\n  boolean transient = false;\n  boolean retriable = false;\n  DOMString name = \"\";\n};\n\ninterface ErrorCondition {\n  constructor(optional DOMString message = \"\", optional ConditionInit init = {});\n  readonly attribute boolean transient;\n  readonly attribute boolean retriable;\n  readonly attribute DOMString name;\n  readonly attribute DOMString message;\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Note that this interface <em>intentionally</em> mimics <code class=\"notranslate\">DOMException</code> with the inclusion of a <code class=\"notranslate\">name</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">message</code> accessors.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Example use (assuming the proposal to add <code class=\"notranslate\">cause</code> to <code class=\"notranslate\">DOMException</code> goes through):</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"const err = new DOMException('The operation failed', {\n  name: 'NETWORK_ERR',\n  cause: new ErrorCondition('The network path is down', {\n    transient: true,\n    retriable: true,\n  })\n});\n\nconsole.log(err.cause.transient);  // true\nconsole.log(err.cause.retriable); // true\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">const err = new DOMException('The operation failed', {\n  name: 'NETWORK_ERR',\n  cause: new ErrorCondition('The network path is down', {\n    transient: true,\n    retriable: true,\n  })\n});\n\nconsole.log(err.cause.transient);  // true\nconsole.log(err.cause.retriable); // true\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To be clear, I don't really have strong opinions on exactly how we solve this use case. My only requirement is that we have a mechanism for reliably communicating transient/retriable conditions that is interoperable across runtimes.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Some questions</h2>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li>How are retriable errors like this handled elsewhere on the web?</li>\n</ol>",

For example, there is the <code class=\"notranslate\">Request</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">Response</code> constructors accepting <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-urlsearchparams\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code class=\"notranslate\">URLSearchParams</code></a> and <a href=\"https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-formdata\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code class=\"notranslate\">FormData</code></a> objects as the request/response body, which is generally useful and is expected to be part of the common minimum API.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, the fetch spec also defines the <a href=\"https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-body-formdata\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code class=\"notranslate\">formData()</code></a> method of the <code class=\"notranslate\">Body</code> interface mixin, which is included in <code class=\"notranslate\">Request</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">Response</code>. This method parses the HTTP body as a form submission enctype (either <code class=\"notranslate\">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> or <code class=\"notranslate\">multipart/form-data</code>) and returns a <code class=\"notranslate\">FormData</code> object. Since form submission bodies only generally make sense as requests, and it's rarely useful to parse a request body from an HTTP client, it wouldn't make much sense to include this method as part of the common minimum API – but it is certainly useful for fetch-based HTTP server APIs, as Deno and CFW have.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For <code class=\"notranslate\">multipart/form-data</code> parsing, however, this method leaves things almost completely unspecified. While there is a formal definition of this format (in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7578\" rel=\"nofollow\">RFC7578</a>, which relies on <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046#section-5.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">the <code class=\"notranslate\">multipart</code> definitions in RFC2046</a>), it is in the form of an ABNF grammar rather than a parsing algorithms, and so different implementations differ in how they parse some input.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">What's more, browsers have not always escaped field names and filenames in <code class=\"notranslate\">multipart/form-data</code> payloads in the same way. For example, until last year Firefox escaped double quotes by prepending a backslash, and newlines by turning them into spaces; while Chromium and Webkit used percent-encoding. And while this percent-encoding behavior was added to the HTML spec (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"784103377\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6282\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/whatwg/html/pull/6282/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6282\">whatwg/html#6282</a>), and FIrefox's behavior fixed in turn, no implementation of the parsing that I'm aware of (including Chromium and Webkit!)

But for WinterCG runtimes with a fetch-based HTTP server API, being able to parse form submissions with the existing fetch API is crucial, and being able to accurately parse the form submissions that all browser engines are currently submitting is a large part of that. So this seems like a very interesting issue to tackle as part of the WinterCG project.</p>",
