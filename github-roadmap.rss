<p dir="auto">Our new "Default or Advanced" option gives security managers the freedom to choose the setup that best fits their organization, while ensuring security requirements are consistently met across their repositories. This will allow enforcement of security configurations to hold even when some repositories need to use Advanced Setup for code scanning, solving a common customer pain point with security configurations and code scanning.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">This will result in more repositories with code scanning running properly and fewer repositories that need bespoke security configurations.</p>]]></content>

<p dir="auto">Today, organization administrator is a special "membership type", that isn't assignable using the standard roles and permissions system. The biggest implication of this is that teams cannot be assigned the "organization administrator" role, and requires users to manually be given the role.</p>
<p dir="auto">When the organization administrator role is supported, administrators will be able to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Assign the role to a team, which has the side effect of making it possible to @mention all the admins (if you like).</li>
<li>Link that team to an IDP group</li>
<li>Use your IDP to then manage who an administrator of that organization is.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">JIT permission management systems, such as PIM, can also use this to elevate users to the "admin group" on demand, to let them take actions that aren't supported by the custom role platform yet, and then automatically drop back to standard permissions.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">Organization administrator will be a role that can be assigned to a team, like any other role at the organization level. Users in that team (or a child team) will be full administrators of the organization it's assigned in.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the future, organization administrator will also be available from the enterprise level, so that users and enterprise teams can be assigned that role against multiple organizations at once.</p>]]></content>

<p dir="auto">We are adding new capabilities to manage artifact attestations more effectively:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Delete attestations</strong>: Easily delete artifact attestations through the UI or API to remove unwanted attestations, such as those linked to malicious or vulnerable artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Bulk operations</strong>: Use API endpoints to perform bulk actions on attestations, saving time when managing multiple attestations.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced filtering</strong>: Quickly locate the attestations you need by filtering by predicate type, subject name or creation date.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive list view</strong>: The attestations list view (<code class="notranslate">&lt;repository&gt;/attestations</code>) will become more interactive. You will be able to select one or multiple attestations to perform bulk actions, such as downloading or deleting. Additionally, you will be able to sort attestations by oldest or newest creation date.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">Today, users can publish attestations, but once they're published, they have limited controls over them. They cannot delete existing attestations, even if they were created by accident. There is no built-in mechanism to expire attestations, which means they remain active indefinitely. To address this, we want to introduce lifecycle management capabilities that enable users to control the status and EOL of their attestations, including the ability to manage them in bulk.</p>]]></content>

<p dir="auto">Rust is becoming a more popular languages and more enterprises are adopting it as an alternative to C/C++. Rust support for CodeQL allows organizations to analyse their proprietary Rust codebases for potential security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">Users using Rust to build their applications will start seeing files written in Rust included in the list of files scanned by CodeQL. This means that they will potentially see new CodeQL relevant to Rust. This will help find and fix issues from additional code bases and improve the overall security posture of the applications scanned with CodeQL.</p>]]></content>

<p dir="auto">We have learned through extensive user feedback that in order to successfully remediate code scanning alerts it's of crucial importance that the work can be tracked and managed alongside other development work. We are adding assignees to code scanning alerts so that developers can more easily take ownership of the alerts they are responsible for and track the work to address the alerts without relying on external tracking systems. Similarly, security managers can track which issues are assigned in order to ensure that most important risks are being addressed and more easily audit alert activity across a single surface</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">Users will be able to plan and track the work required to address high priority code scanning alerts alongside their day-to-day development -- resulting in better engagement with the alerts and improved remediation outcomes.</p>]]></content>

<p dir="auto">Today, only PATs (Personal Access Tokens) <em>Classic</em> can interact with the Enterprise account - managing SCIM and users, creating organizations, setting policy, and provisioning self-hosted runners, as popular examples. By switching to fine-grained PATs for these APIs, enterprises get a better least-privilege security posture. With this release, you can use tokens with <em>just</em> enough permission to accomplish the job instead of a PAT (Classic) that requires permission to do <em>anything</em> to your enterprise.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">This release trails <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1797336912" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/793" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/github/roadmap/issues/793/hovercard" href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/793">#793</a>, which establishes the fine-grained permissions model for the enterprise. Because each API must be updated individually to support new permissions, not every single API will be supported at the time of the public preview. We are prioritizing the most popular APIs to ensure that enterprises can replace the highest number of PATs (Classic), and will ship with at least those for the public preview.</p>
<p dir="auto">These APIs are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Self-hosted runner management</li>
<li>Organization creation</li>
<li>SCIM support, for platforms that cannot use a GitHub App for provisioning</li>
<li>Enterprise team creation and management</li>

<p dir="auto">Today, fine-grained PATs (Personal Access Tokens) can only be targeted to a single organization, which can be very restrictive for developers who's workflows span multiple organizations. Right now they're stuck juggling multiple tokens, or more likely falling back to PATs (Classic) at the cost of improved security.</p>
<p dir="auto">With multi-targeting, a single fine-grained PAT can be given access to multiple organizations at once, allowing more developers to move off of PATs (Classic).</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">When creating a fine-grained PAT, developers can pick which enterprise they'd like to target, and then select the organizations within that enterprise the token should be valid for. The permissions selected for the token will be the same in each organization - selecting specific permissions per organization is not supported in this release.</p>
<p dir="auto">For each organization that has an approval process setup, the token will have to be approved. Organization access will light up on a one by one basis as those approvals are granted.</p>
<p dir="auto">At this time, for the sake of governance and isolation, we are not looking to let a token access multiple unrelated organizations. Thus, Free-plan and Team-plan organizations you are a member of would still have to be individually targeted with a token.</p>]]></content>

<p dir="auto">After over two years in public beta, we've seen millions of requests a day using Fine-Grained PATs and adoption across the platform - enough to say that it's time to call them GA. While there's more work to be done before we can say they entirely replace PATs (Classic), we know that fine-grained PATs aren't going anywhere and are ready for production use in your company, unlocking= visibility and control over the tokens used to access your organizations, and finer-grained permissions to ensure least privilege access.</p>
<p dir="auto">This release also brings PAT expiration policies (for fine-grained PATs and PATs (Classic)) to GA as well, allowing you to force the rotation of PATs in your enterprise or organization.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">In the public preview, fine-grained PATs were an opt-in mechanism for organizations - if a user wanted to create a fine-grained PAT with access to an organization, the organization had to first allow fine-grained PATs to be created at all.</p>
<p dir="auto">With this change, <strong>fine-grained PATs will be enabled by default for all organizations</strong>. Organizations and enterprises that <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization#restricting-access-by-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens">explicitly blocked fine-grained PATs</a> during the preview will continue to have them disabled with this GA.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Remaining limitations with GA</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is not the end of the story for fine-grained PATs. Our intent is to continue investing in them to ensure that they can entirely replace the use of PATs (Classic) in your workflows, letting you get the best security possible no matter where you use them. We know there are gaps in the fine-grained PATs implementation that may prevent you from using them everywhere, and we will continue working on fine-grained PATs to unblock your use cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">Critically, this milestone does not include interactions with the Enterprise object. This means enterprise role management, organization creation, SCIM user management, and enterprise audit logs, among other enterprise APIs, will not be possible with a fine-grained PAT. Supporting enterprise object access with a fine-grained PAT or GitHub App is an ongoing project that will ensure full parity with PATs (Classic) and OAuth apps.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are also organization- and repository-level gaps that we need to fill, to ensure that every API and every developer workflow is unblocked.</p>
<p dir="auto">These items include:</p>

<p dir="auto">CodeQL is the static analysis engine that powers GitHub’s code scanning capabilities. In Pull Requests, it can pinpoint potential vulnerabilities and deliver detailed insights alongside automated remediation suggestions through <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/secure-code-more-than-three-times-faster-with-copilot-autofix" rel="nofollow">Copilot Autofix</a>. With this update, CodeQL <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/about-codeql-queries/">queries</a> focus exclusively on newly introduced code rather than rescanning the entire codebase, streamlining the analysis process.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">Developers receive faster feedback during Pull Requests, reducing the time needed to identify and fix emerging vulnerabilities. This speed enhancement maintains the same quality of results on the Pull Requests page while accelerating the remediation process, enabling teams to secure their code more efficiently without compromising on thoroughness.</p>]]></content>
