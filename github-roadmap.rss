<p dir="auto">Today, only PATs (Personal Access Tokens) <em>Classic</em> can interact with the Enterprise account - managing SCIM and users, creating organizations, setting policy, and provisioning self-hosted runners, as popular examples. By switching to fine-grained PATs for these APIs, enterprises get a better least-privilege security posture. With this release, you can use tokens with <em>just</em> enough permission to accomplish the job instead of a PAT (Classic) that requires permission to do <em>anything</em> to your enterprise.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">This release trails <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1797336912" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/793" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/github/roadmap/issues/793/hovercard" href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/793">#793</a>, which establishes the fine-grained permissions model for the enterprise. Because each API must be updated individually to support new permissions, not every single API will be supported at the time of the public preview. We are prioritizing the most popular APIs to ensure that enterprises can replace the highest number of PATs (Classic), and will ship with at least those for the public preview.</p>
<p dir="auto">These APIs are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Self-hosted runner management</li>
<li>Organization creation</li>
<li>SCIM support, for platforms that cannot use a GitHub App for provisioning</li>
<li>Enterprise team creation and management</li>
<li>Budgeting and Licensing management</li>
</ol>]]></content>

<p dir="auto">Today, fine-grained PATs (Personal Access Tokens) can only be targeted to a single organization, which can be very restrictive for developers who's workflows span multiple organizations. Right now they're stuck juggling multiple tokens, or more likely falling back to PATs (Classic) at the cost of improved security.</p>
<p dir="auto">With multi-targeting, a single fine-grained PAT can be given access to multiple organizations at once, allowing more developers to move off of PATs (Classic).</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">When creating a fine-grained PAT, developers can pick which enterprise they'd like to target, and then select the organizations within that enterprise the token should be valid for. The permissions selected for the token will be the same in each organization - selecting specific permissions per organization is not supported in this release.</p>
<p dir="auto">For each organization that has an approval process setup, the token will have to be approved. Organization access will light up on a one by one basis as those approvals are granted.</p>
<p dir="auto">At this time, for the sake of governance and isolation, we are not looking to let a token access multiple unrelated organizations. Thus, Free-plan and Team-plan organizations you are a member of would still have to be individually targeted with a token.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134638657?u=796627b7b5613a75768e410a1ef8cd04cea589d7&v=4" width="64" height="64" alt=""/><br/><h3 dir="auto">Value Prop</h3>
<p dir="auto">After over two years in public beta, we've seen millions of requests a day using Fine-Grained PATs and adoption across the platform - enough to say that it's time to call them GA. While there's more work to be done before we can say they entirely replace PATs (Classic), we know that fine-grained PATs aren't going anywhere and are ready for production use in your company, unlocking= visibility and control over the tokens used to access your organizations, and finer-grained permissions to ensure least privilege access.</p>
<p dir="auto">This release also brings PAT expiration policies (for fine-grained PATs and PATs (Classic)) to GA as well, allowing you to force the rotation of PATs in your enterprise or organization.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">In the public preview, fine-grained PATs were an opt-in mechanism for organizations - if a user wanted to create a fine-grained PAT with access to an organization, the organization had to first allow fine-grained PATs to be created at all.</p>
<p dir="auto">With this change, <strong>fine-grained PATs will be enabled by default for all organizations</strong>. Organizations and enterprises that <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization#restricting-access-by-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens">explicitly blocked fine-grained PATs</a> during the preview will continue to have them disabled with this GA.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Remaining limitations with GA</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is not the end of the story for fine-grained PATs. Our intent is to continue investing in them to ensure that they can entirely replace the use of PATs (Classic) in your workflows, letting you get the best security possible no matter where you use them. We know there are gaps in the fine-grained PATs implementation that may prevent you from using them everywhere, and we will continue working on fine-grained PATs to unblock your use cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">Critically, this milestone does not include interactions with the Enterprise object. This means enterprise role management, organization creation, SCIM user management, and enterprise audit logs, among other enterprise APIs, will not be possible with a fine-grained PAT. Supporting enterprise object access with a fine-grained PAT or GitHub App is an ongoing project that will ensure full parity with PATs (Classic) and OAuth apps.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are also organization- and repository-level gaps that we need to fill, to ensure that every API and every developer workflow is unblocked.</p>
<p dir="auto">These items include:</p>

<p dir="auto">We are building a new way to publish and consume actions that will improve the security of the CI/CD supply chain. Building on top of the OCI distribution specification, actions can now be pushed to GitHub Packages as immutable image versions with familiar semantic versions. The immutable packages and semantic versions bring greater predictability and security to users' workflows.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Expected Outcome</h3>
<p dir="auto">Users consuming actions will be able to reference an immutable package of an action by version, providing better security in their CI/CD supply chain. Over time we will build additional functionality like signing, build attestation, malware scanning, etc. to further improve the security of the supply chain and allow organizations to apply more specific policies. Developers creating Actions will have a fully automated workflow for publishing their actions that follows a natural build, package, and publish model with standard package versioning.</p>
<p dir="auto">Actions publishers will use a new packaging action and workflow to take their existing actions code and publish it to GitHub Packages. Users consuming actions by version tags will automatically start getting the packaged version of the action after it is published. Those referencing by commit SHA or git branch reference will simply need to switch to an appropriate version.</p>]]></content>
