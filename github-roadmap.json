Enterprise roles will allow more people to get work done at the enterprise level, without exposing enterprise customers to more risk by granting the highly privileged <code class=\"notranslate\">enterprise owner</code> role.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">While most users don't need to interact with the enterprise, there are quite a few highly-sensitive actions that enterprise administrators take, such as <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise\">setting up SAML</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/adding-organizations-to-your-enterprise\">creating organizations</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/exploring-user-activity/managing-global-webhooks\">registering webhooks</a>. We will allow enterprise administrators to enable a member to do one of these things without letting them do all of them, to reduce their risk profile.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There are also less-risky activities, such as <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/about-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise\">reading the audit log</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/customizing-user-messages-for-your-enterprise\">putting up announcement banners</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise\">verifying domains for members</a>. To reduce friction while getting things done, enterprise administrators will be able to grant these permissions to members widely (as needed) without worrying about providing broad access to highly privileged actions.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Like repository and organization custom roles, enterprise owners will be able to create custom roles that contain a set of permissions against the enterprise object. Fine-grained permissions, such as those listed in the examples above, will be made available to craft these custom roles. These enterprise-level fine-grained permissions will work against the UK and API. When assigned to a member of an enterprise, an enterprise-level custom role will allow the user to access certain parts of the enterprise settings, and take certain actions, depending on the permissions in the role.</p>",

Further, you have the ability to create repository-level custom security roles with any of the following security manager permissions to a user or team:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>View secret scanning</li>\n<li>Dismiss secret scanning</li>\n<li>View code scanning</li>\n<li>Dismiss code scanning</li>\n<li>Delete code scanning alerts</li>\n<li>View Dependabot alerts</li>\n<li>Dismiss Dependabot alerts</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Enterprises wanting more personalized control over security manager permissions for their organization will benefit from upcoming enhancements. The enhancements will offer advanced control over security permissions, meeting growing demands for custom access levels.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This feature aims to give you advanced control over security permissions, accommodating your increasing need for customized access levels.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The security manager role will continue to exist, but will be enhanced so that you can assign the role to individual users in addition to teams at the organization level.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Moreover, enterprises will be able to create customized security manager roles at the organization level using the listed security permissions. These custom roles can have a combination of organization-wide permissions (like viewing the organization's audit log) and repository-specific permissions (such as allowing Dependabot alert view access) for all organization's repositories.
