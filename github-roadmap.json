Organization Admins can now self-serve information to empower them to answer questions like which repo is using the most minutes, which workflows have changed resulting in more use and how their split of minutes usage compares across different operating systems.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Intended Outcome</strong><br>\nPreviously, Admins had to look across a range of un-supported data sources extracting information and then still struggled to answer questions like ‘which workflow is driving the most use across all of my runner types’. For self-hosted customers, managing their fleets and finding bottlenecks was also hard, requiring them to source verbatim rather than use a real data source. With the new data view CodeBlock, CI/CD admins can create views of Actions data for them and other team members to consume across their organization. With the new API GitHub Admins can query for a range of data allowing them to answer questions about all of their runners and workflows in GitHub.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>How will it work?</strong> <br>\nGetting started will be easy.

GitHub has introduced a turnkey set of tools that allow enterprise admins to give GitHub Actions access to the resources their teams need inside their private networks. This means that teams can now access their internal APIs, Databases, Artifactory instances and more from GitHub’s hosted runners.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Intended Outcome</strong><br>\nThis enables Actions to connect to Azure services, such as Azure Storage, in a secure manner using service endpoints or to on-premises data sources, taking advantage of user-defined routes. You can also connect Actions to a network virtual appliance to inspect all outbound traffic and take actions according to allow and deny rules. Finally you can configure Actions to use custom DNS and configure network security group (NSG) rules to specify egress traffic restrictions.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>How will it work?</strong><br>\nWith the introduction of GitHub’s secure networking for Actions, customers on Azure can now set up an integration with their <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azure subscriptions Virtual Networks </a>(VNets). This solution enables service traffic to go through the Azure backbone network, isolating communication from the public Internet and effectively injecting the Actions runner into your private network.</p>",
