To make it easier to manage these organizations at scale, Enterprise and Organization administrators can use a new page in the enterprise settings to assign an enterprise team or user a <a href=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/586\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/github/roadmap/issues/586/hovercard\">custom</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/977\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/github/roadmap/issues/977/hovercard\">pre-defined role</a> across a set of organizations. This relieves the administrator of complex automation or manual clicking though dozens of organizations.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Both enterprise and organization administrators need to manage their organizations as scale, as we frequently see a set of organizations representing a sub-unit within a company, all of which share the same administrative personnel.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">By using enterprise teams and organization roles, administrators can easily ensure that the right sets of people are the organization administrators, security managers, auditors, and DevSecOps managers across all of those organizations.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Enterprise administrators can create organization roles that are owned by the enterprise. Like Repository roles that an organization administrator creates, these roles are available in each organization in the enterprise.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Administrators can then select from these roles (as well as the pre-defined organization roles that GitHub ships with) and apply them to an enterprise team within the context of a select set of organizations. The enterprise team members will become members of each organization, and receive the organization role in each organization.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The organization role that a team gets in one organization does not change their permissions outside of the organization, which allows you to have e.g. a DevOps team with <code class=\"notranslate\">admin</code> roles in the automation organizations, and a custom <code class=\"notranslate\">devops</code> role in all of the other organizations in the enterprise.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">You can optionally select <code class=\"notranslate\">all</code> organizations for the assignment, which will add the users to all current and future organizations, with the chosen role.</p>",

Metadata includes issues, pull requests, releases, and attachments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To support the migration of larger repositories to GitHub and between GitHub products, we will be increasing the repository size limits to:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>40 GB size limit for a Git repository</li>\n<li>40 GB limit for metadata</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Customers will be capable of migrating larger repositories using GEI.

This feature allows users to assign a set of static IPs to a runner or runner group, and also provides the option to use Azure private networking for macOS runners. By executing workflows behind the protection of the Azure Virtual Network, customers can ensure additional network security for workflows that require access to private resources within their network. This will be particularly useful for developers who have enabled IP allow lists, as they can now assign a specific set of static IPs to macOS runners.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">GitHub now offers private networking capabilities for hosted macOS runners, which enables users to securely access private resources within their on-prem or cloud-based locations, such as databases, artifactory, storage accounts, or APIs. Developers can enforce network security policies and outbound access rules on the runners, which can help to reduce data exfiltration risks. Additionally, developers can isolate their build traffic from the public internet and route it through their existing private network connections (such as VPN or ExpressRoute).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The process of assigning static IPs or setting up Azure private networking for macOS runners is the same as it is for Ubuntu and Windows runners.

This role is designed to empower a designated team with comprehensive security management capabilities across all organizations within your enterprise. Members assigned to this role will have the authority to manage enterprise-wide security settings and code security policies, access security-related enterprise APIs, and oversee all data within the enterprise-level security overview pages. Additionally, they will possess all the permissions currently held by organization-level security managers.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Our enterprise customers have expressed a more streamlined way to empower their security-focused teams without the added complexity of adding a security manager team to each organization. Moreover, these teams often require access to enterprise-level policies and security settings, which traditionally have been reserved for the enterprise owner or granted only partially. This new role addresses these needs by providing:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Simplified, centralized access management across all organizations with just a few clicks.</li>\n<li>Expanded permissions that encompass both organization-level and enterprise-level oversight and control.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The enterprise security manager role is designed to be assigned collectively to an <a href=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap-internal/issues/886\">enterprise team</a> and the process will involve only two steps:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li><strong>Create an enterprise team</strong>: Your enterprise owner will begin by forming an enterprise team, similar how you create a team at the organization level today.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant organization membership and roles</strong>: Your enterprise owner will then grant organization membership and assign the security manager role to the enterprise team all in a few simple clicks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Once the team is configured, team members will be able to:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Manage security settings and code security policies at the enterprise level.</li>\n<li>Access enterprise-level security-related APIs.</li>\n<li>View security data for all organizations in the enterprise-level security overview.</li>\n<li>Retain the capabilities typically granted to organization security managers, including the ability to view and dismiss alerts and configure security settings at the organization and repository levels.</li>\n</ul>",
