These runners will be fully managed by GitHub with a base image containing a foundational set of tools. Powered by the Ampere Altra Arm–based processor, these runners offer a power efficient compute layer which can increase price to performance ratios, allowing customers to optimize compute costs.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Customers are refactoring their applications to take advantage of the price performance benefits of ARM architecture. Developers can now run their workloads on Arm-based hardware hosted by GitHub to build and deploy their release assets anywhere Arm’s architecture is used. These new runners provide power, performance &amp; sustainability improvements for all your Actions jobs.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To get started using Arm-based GitHub-hosted runners, create a runner in a runner group choosing Arm as the hardware. Then update the <code class=\"notranslate\">runs-on:</code> key in your Actions workflow YAML to have those jobs target the new runner.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To sign up, please visit <a href=\"https://resources.github.com/devops/accelerate-your-cicd-with-arm-and-gpu-runners-in-github-actions/\">this link</a>.</p>",
