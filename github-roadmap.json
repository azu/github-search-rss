Organization owners can invite your personal account to join their organization that uses SAML SSO, which allows you to contribute to the organization and retain your existing identity and contributions on GitHub.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">When you access resources within an organization that uses SAML SSO, GitHub will redirect you to the organization's SAML IdP to authenticate. After you successfully authenticate with your account on the IdP, the IdP redirects you back to GitHub, where you can access the organization's resources.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The purpose of this feature is to augment existing audit log events with the SAML identity associated with the user who took the relevant action. In doing so, customers using GitHub Enterprise will be able to track activity associated with a specific SAML identity in the enterprise and organization audit logs.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Enterprise and Organization owners will be able to track audit log activity associated with specific SAML SSO identities. By providing the SAML SSO identity as part of the audit log, enterprise and organization owners can quickly and easily link logs from multiple sourcing using the same SAML SSO identity identifiers.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The <code class=\"notranslate\">external_identity_nameid</code> or <code class=\"notranslate\">external_identity_username</code> will be displayed in all audit log events where the SAML SSO identity was used as a means of authentication.</p>",

Earlier this summer, following a successful year long technical preview with more than 1.2 million developers, <a href=\"https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">we launched GitHub Copilot for individuals</a>. The feedback received from the community has made it abundantly clear: AI is one of the best tools to empower the next generation of developers. With GitHub Copilot, developers have more time and space to focus on solving bigger problems and building even better software.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">GitHub Copilot is effective at solving many introductory programming assignments, which may impact how you assess your students. One <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3511861.3511863\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> found that solutions generated by GitHub Copilot placed it amongst the top 25% of students in a cohort.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We recognize that student's use of GitHub Copilot will likely change the way you plan new lessons, and are committed to partnering closely with our teacher community on how GitHub Copilot can support you and your students. By offering GitHub Copilot free of charge to teachers, we hope to make it easier for teachers to understand and anticipate the impact on student assignments. If youâ€™re interested in sharing your experience, feedback, or ideas, please <a href=\"https://github.com/community/Global-Campus-Teachers/discussions/118\">join the conversation</a> with other verified teachers on GitHub Global Campus.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">If you're a teacher, but haven't been verified yet, <a href=\"https://education.github.com/discount_requests/teacher_application\">join GitHub Global Campus for teachers.</a></p>",

You can also connect Actions to a network virtual appliance to inspect all outbound traffic and take actions according to allow and deny rules. Finally you can configure Actions to use custom DNS and configure network security group (NSG) rules to specify egress traffic restrictions.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>How will it work?</strong><br>\nWith the introduction of GitHubâ€™s secure networking for Actions, customers on Azure can now set up an integration with their <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azure subscriptions Virtual Networks </a>(VNets).

With audit log streaming, customers can be assured that no audit log event will be lost, and that they will be able to satisfy longer term data retention goals by storing streamed events within their own log aggregation systems. Administrators will be able to analyze GitHub audit log data using Datadog's products.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">An enterprise owner will be able to configure a destination domain, port, and token with write authorization to the streaming endpoint.</p>",
