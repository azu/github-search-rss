To provide a more comprehensive view for larger enterprises, we aim to build an enterprise-level dashboard to aggregate and present data across all organizations within an enterprise. This enterprise-level dashboard will offer a macro view of application security metrics, aiding in broader strategic decisions and analyses.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Enterprise users require the ability to analyze data across their enterprise. This feature will give application security users the ability to view aggregated data from all organizations within my enterprise in a single, unified dashboard so that they can easily compare and analyze metrics at an enterprise scale to make informed, overarching decisions regarding security and development practices.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Security managers and organization owners will be able to access an overview of code security metrics through the enterprise account page. This dashboard will offer a consolidated view of security metrics across organizations that are currently only available at the organization level.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In cases where users have access to multiple organizations, they will have the flexibility of filtering by organization.</p>",

Key questions like, \"How many alerts were dismissed as false positives?\" or \"How many were actually remediated?\" can now be answered effortlessly. This feature aims to empower security managers to monitor, track, and audit resolved alerts with precision, ultimately enhancing your organization's ability to address and reduce vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The updated security overview dashboard will introduce a new \"Close Reason\" grouping option within the alert trends graph. Additionally, you can apply filters using close reasons on both the dashboard and individual alert pages. For instance, you can display alerts marked as \"risk accepted\" using the filter <code class=\"notranslate\">close-reason:risk-accepted</code>, allowing for a more granular and focused analysis of security alerts.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><em>New close reason alert trends grouping:</em></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/94867353/334500064-e04020d2-83e0-47e0-aee2-1b2e528f5027.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.CDdfp3Px3Tq7hukkMEToXqzVixW5qeCV1JoFZlgJsjM\"><img src=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/94867353/334500064-e04020d2-83e0-47e0-aee2-1b2e528f5027.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.CDdfp3Px3Tq7hukkMEToXqzVixW5qeCV1JoFZlgJsjM\" alt=\"Image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a></p>",

This role is designed to empower a designated team with comprehensive security management capabilities across all organizations within your enterprise. Members assigned to this role will have the authority to manage enterprise-wide security settings and code security policies, access security-related enterprise APIs, and oversee all data within the enterprise-level security overview pages. Additionally, they will possess all the permissions currently held by organization-level security managers.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Our enterprise customers have expressed a more streamlined way to empower their security-focused teams without the added complexity of adding a security manager team to each organization. Moreover, these teams often require access to enterprise-level policies and security settings, which traditionally have been reserved for the enterprise owner or granted only partially. This new role addresses these needs by providing:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Simplified, centralized access management across all organizations with just a few clicks.</li>\n<li>Expanded permissions that encompass both organization-level and enterprise-level oversight and control.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The enterprise security manager role is designed to be assigned collectively to an <a href=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap-internal/issues/886\">enterprise team</a> and the process will involve only two steps:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li><strong>Create an enterprise team</strong>: Your enterprise owner will begin by forming an enterprise team, similar how you create a team at the organization level today.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant organization membership and roles</strong>: Your enterprise owner will then grant organization membership and assign the security manager role to the enterprise team all in a few simple clicks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Once the team is configured, team members will be able to:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Manage security settings and code security policies at the enterprise level.</li>\n<li>Access enterprise-level security-related APIs.</li>\n<li>View security data for all organizations in the enterprise-level security overview.</li>\n<li>Retain the capabilities typically granted to organization security managers, including the ability to view and dismiss alerts and configure security settings at the organization and repository levels.</li>\n</ul>",

This data helps organizations locate areas of improvement in their software delivery lifecycle, saving time and money.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Organizations get high quality, relevant and actionable data about Actions usage including workflow and job execution details for hosted and self hosted runners.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Customers can filter data by any combination of workflows, jobs, repositories, runtime OS, and runner type to view total minutes, number of jobs, workflow executions, and more.

This update helps remove one of the last reasons developers and administrators are forced to use OAuth apps instead of the more secure and manageable GitHub app platform.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">App developers will be able to specify Enterprises as a resource target, similar to how organizations and users are selected today. New fine-grained permissions (such as <code class=\"notranslate\">enterprise_audit_log:read</code>) will be created, which administrators can then grant to apps installed on their enterprise.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The initial permission that this will ship with is the ability to manage GitHub Apps installed on organizations in the enterprise. This will allow administrators to automate the installation, uninstallation, and blocking of apps within their enterprise.
