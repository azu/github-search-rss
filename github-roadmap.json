Rather than manually configuring security settings for each individual organization, this role enables a single, centralized team to enforce security policies, monitor alerts, and access critical security data across all organizations in one unified view.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Additionally, this is a game-changer for GHES customers, who often manage security across dozens or even hundreds of organizations. By eliminating the need to set up security managers for each organization individually, the enterprise security manager role allows your team to oversee security operations across all organizations in the enterprise in just a few clicks—delivering faster, more consistent protection at scale.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Expected Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Our enterprise customers have expressed a more streamlined way to empower their security-focused teams without the added complexity of adding a security manager team to each organization. Moreover, these teams often require access to enterprise-level policies and security settings, which traditionally have been reserved for the enterprise owner or granted only partially. This new role addresses these needs by providing:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Simplified, centralized access management across all organizations with just a few clicks.</li>\n<li>Expanded permissions that encompass both organization-level and enterprise-level oversight and control.</li>\n</ul>",

In this public preview we are granting access to several features in one experience:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Enterprise Custom Roles</li>\n<li>Enterprise Fine-Grained Permissions (FGP)</li>\n<li>Enterprise Teams</li>\n<li>Enterprise Apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">All Enterprise-level features, current and future, will support the fine-grained permissions model, for both user roles and GitHub App installations. The result is that enterprise administrators can delegate their work safely to other users in their enterprise or GitHub Apps for automation.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Expected Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We are enabling a least-privilege, custom role-based access control model that works well in multi-org enterprise deployments. Permissions are granular enough to let you grant access via roles, to teams and apps, that is no more than what is required to get a specific job done.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">During this preview program we will continue to add more FGP and API coverage to comprehensively address needs for enterprise administration at scale. We expect that administrators will consolidate many organization teams to a more manageable set of enterprise teams deployed to multiple organizations. We want to see more enterprises, especially those with very large single organizations, take advantage of these features and create additional organizations to logically group their work.</p>",

This lets users perform complex, orchestrated tasks beyond code and text generation, bringing external tools right into Copilot Chat. With extensions in GA, developers can rely on improved platform stability, clear support SLAs, OIDC support, transparent messages about data access limits, and availability across new environments like Mobile and JetBrains(with more to come).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Customer Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">As Copilot Extensions move into GA, developers and organizations can now tailor Copilot’s capabilities to fit their unique tech stack, boosting productivity across teams. Admins can control over which GitHub organization and repository data is accessible to extensions through app authorizations, with transparent messages around permission gates. Organizations can also build and share private, enterprise-grade extensions, ensuring consistency and streamlined workflows across teams and projects. This enables secure, efficient task automation and context retrieval, cutting down research time and accelerating developer velocity.</p>",
