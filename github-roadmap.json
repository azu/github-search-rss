This feature allows users to assign a set of static IPs to a runner or runner group, and also provides the option to use Azure private networking for macOS runners. By executing workflows behind the protection of the Azure Virtual Network, customers can ensure additional network security for workflows that require access to private resources within their network. This will be particularly useful for developers who have enabled IP allow lists, as they can now assign a specific set of static IPs to macOS runners.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">GitHub now offers private networking capabilities for hosted macOS runners, which enables users to securely access private resources within their on-prem or cloud-based locations, such as databases, artifactory, storage accounts, or APIs. Developers can enforce network security policies and outbound access rules on the runners, which can help to reduce data exfiltration risks. Additionally, developers can isolate their build traffic from the public internet and route it through their existing private network connections (such as VPN or ExpressRoute).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The process of assigning static IPs or setting up Azure private networking for macOS runners is the same as it is for Ubuntu and Windows runners.

This intuitive interface categorizes your security insights into three distinct, streamlined domains: detection, remediation, and prevention. Experience enhanced visibility with top-line metrics from GitHub Advanced Security’s preventative features such as secret scanning’s push protection and CodeQL’s alerts in pull requests. This refined design ensures that you can quickly and easily understand your security metrics, enabling more effective decision-making at a glance.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Security managers often struggle to effectively quantify and communicate the critical metrics from the key security activities. This redesigned dashboard makes it straightforward to navigate and understand the current status of your security operations. With immediate access to tangible metrics and insights, this feature empowers you to proactively manage prevention and remediation efforts, demonstrate their impact, and ultimately reduce your enterprise's risk exposure significantly.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The updated security overview dashboard introduces a dedicated prevention section, displaying essential metrics. You'll find vital indicators such as the number of vulnerabilities detected in pull requests, the tally of alerts resolved through autofix, and the count of secrets proactively blocked. Further, the existing dashboard components for detection and remediation have been refined to seamlessly integrate with this new structure. This comprehensive and actionable view enables your team to continually optimize and fortify your security protocols.</p>",
