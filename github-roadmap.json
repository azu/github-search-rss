Many of these are stale or obsolete, but previously there was no easy way to archive a once-active organization: you had to individually archive each repository in the org, and even then the top-level org still permitted repo creation, new teams, etc. This added to the toil of enterprise administration and made for an inconsistent, unpleasant experience for open source maintainers, OSPO managers, and IT teams responsible for managing their GitHub presence.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Our new feature lightens this burden by adding a button to the Organization Settings \"Danger Zone\" which will:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>archive all the repositories in the organization</li>\n<li>restrict many \"write\" activities in that organization, such as creating new repos</li>\n<li>set a key in the API to indicate the org has been archived</li>\n</ul>",

This allows developers to gain control over their supply chain and reduce the average duration of their workflows by customizing the software, tools, and files on Actions Hosted runners before a workflow starts.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">33% of Actions people run are to set up tools/dependencies on their machine before they even start to download images/packages that their application is dependent on. This takes time on every run of that workflow. With custom images developers can now customize those pre-installed tools, saving time by creating a \"pre-warmed\" machine.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">GitHub's image customization allows developers to use their existing workflow YAML to produce images which can be used as the base for their different developer environments. Developers can use the new syntax to take the state of their current environment and save that to an image to be used in future workflows.</p>",

Previously, a user could trigger a workflow and also self-approve a deployment that references an environment where they are one of the required reviewers. We are now introducing an option for environment admins to prevent self-reviews and secure their deployments targeting their critical environments. This would require a different approver to review and sign off the deployments, rather than the same user who triggered the run - making the deployments more secure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Allow deployments only for selected Tag patterns</strong> - Previously we supported <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#deployment-branches\">Deployment Branches</a> with \"Selected Branches\" option. We are now enhancing this feature for controlling deployments to an environment based on ‚Äúselected tag patterns‚Äù.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Configurable timeout for protection rules</strong> - Currently required reviewers (manual approvals) and other deployment protection rules (including <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#custom-deployment-protection-rules\">custom protection rules</a> that are powered by GitHub Apps) configured on an environment have a default of 30 days, post which the deployments timeout and will be considered as \"failed\" deployments. We are now reducing this default to 5 days and allowing it to be configurable upto 15 days as it will help more controlled deployment rollouts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">These enhancements will help admins to have more secure and controlled deployments across Environments</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Admins who want to have more controlled deployments can now prevent self-reviews, configure Tag patterns to say, allow only Releases/* Tags to deploy to their Production Environment. And also configure that if a reviewer doesn't approve a deployment beyond 5 days, then the deployment would just fail.</p>",

These same checks must also pass before a change is merged by the queue. Sometimes it's unnecessary to run certain checks in both places, but there's currently no way around this if the status check is required.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There are also cases where different sets of status checks need to be run based on the changes made in the pull request. This is usually done to reduce CI time and cost and ensure only necessary status checks are run. However, a status check that does not always run cannot be configured as required since it would block merging of changes were the check wasn't run.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The solution is giving teams more ways to configure which status checks are required in different contexts and without having to configure a fixed set of status checks upfront.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Reduce CI costs by not running unnecessary checks</li>\n<li>Reduce time-to-merge</li>\n<li>Avoid requirement to use custom apps and workflows to rollup and report summary when the set of required checks is variable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Admins have other options for choosing which status checks are required. For example, one option may be to require all reported status checks must pass.</p>",

Upon clicking the notification, they'll be able to review the sets of repos where matching code exists as well as an aggregate count of the associated licenses.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Last year, we introduced a GitHub Copilot feature that allows developers to silently block suggestions greater than 150 characters that match public code. But the world‚Äôs developers have a diverse perspective of wants and needs when they‚Äôre building. While simply blocking public code can be useful, a number of developers told us they actually want to see code matches. Some want to learn from other‚Äôs code;  some may want to take a package dependency rather than introduce new business logic; still others want to give or receive credit for similar work. With this feature, we hope to enable them to review extra information about the match and make the decision best fit for them.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">If GitHub Copilot makes a suggestion matching public code, it‚Äôll share a list of the repositories where that code can be found, and their licenses ‚Äì all right in the editor. If there‚Äôs a match, a pop-up window appears that shows you all of the code matches, what their repository licenses are, and how many repositories‚Äîincluding repositories without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories.</p>",

CodeQL can perform security analysis on all such codebases, but it needs to behave slightly differently in each case. If we fail to include types of taint source that are relevant to a codebase, then we may miss important results (false negatives).
