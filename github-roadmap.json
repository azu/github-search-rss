These same checks must also pass before a change is merged by the queue. Sometimes it's unnecessary to run certain checks in both places, but there's currently no way around this if the status check is required.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There are also cases where different sets of status checks need to be run based on the changes made in the pull request. This is usually done to reduce CI time and cost and ensure only necessary status checks are run. However, a status check that does not always run cannot be configured as required since it would block merging of changes were the check wasn't run.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The solution is giving teams more ways to configure which status checks are required in different contexts and without having to configure a fixed set of status checks upfront.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Reduce CI costs by not running unnecessary checks</li>\n<li>Reduce time-to-merge</li>\n<li>Avoid requirement to use custom apps and workflows to rollup and report summary when the set of required checks is variable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Admins have other options for choosing which status checks are required. For example, one option may be to require all reported status checks must pass.</p>",

Upon clicking the notification, they'll be able to review the sets of repos where matching code exists as well as an aggregate count of the associated licenses.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Last year, we introduced a GitHub Copilot feature that allows developers to silently block suggestions greater than 150 characters that match public code. But the world’s developers have a diverse perspective of wants and needs when they’re building. While simply blocking public code can be useful, a number of developers told us they actually want to see code matches. Some want to learn from other’s code;  some may want to take a package dependency rather than introduce new business logic; still others want to give or receive credit for similar work. With this feature, we hope to enable them to review extra information about the match and make the decision best fit for them.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">If GitHub Copilot makes a suggestion matching public code, it’ll share a list of the repositories where that code can be found, and their licenses – all right in the editor. If there’s a match, a pop-up window appears that shows you all of the code matches, what their repository licenses are, and how many repositories—including repositories without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories.</p>",

For example, one codebase might only consider remote HTTP requests tainted to be potentially untrusted, whereas another might also consider local files to be a source of tainted user data. CodeQL can perform security analysis on all such codebases, but it needs to behave slightly differently in each case. If we fail to include types of taint source that are relevant to a codebase, then we may miss important results (false negatives). Conversely, if we include types of taint source that are irrelevant, then we may generate too many results (false positives).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With CodeQL threat model settings, code scanning users will be able to configure which types of tainted data to use in code scanning in the UI.
