By switching to fine-grained PATs for these APIs, enterprises get a better least-privilege security posture.

The permissions selected for the token will be the same in each organization - selecting specific permissions per organization is not supported in this release.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For each organization that has an approval process setup, the token will have to be approved. Organization access will light up on a one by one basis as those approvals are granted.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">At this time, for the sake of governance and isolation, we are not looking to let a token access multiple unrelated organizations.

While there's more work to be done before we can say they entirely replace PATs (Classic), we know that fine-grained PATs aren't going anywhere and are ready for production use in your company, unlocking= visibility and control over the tokens used to access your organizations, and finer-grained permissions to ensure least privilege access.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This release also brings PAT expiration policies (for fine-grained PATs and PATs (Classic)) to GA as well, allowing you to force the rotation of PATs in your enterprise or organization.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Expected Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In the public preview, fine-grained PATs were an opt-in mechanism for organizations - if a user wanted to create a fine-grained PAT with access to an organization, the organization had to first allow fine-grained PATs to be created at all.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With this change, <strong>fine-grained PATs will be enabled by default for all organizations</strong>. Organizations and enterprises that <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization#restricting-access-by-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens\">explicitly blocked fine-grained PATs</a> during the preview will continue to have them disabled with this GA.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Remaining limitations with GA</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This is not the end of the story for fine-grained PATs. Our intent is to continue investing in them to ensure that they can entirely replace the use of PATs (Classic) in your workflows, letting you get the best security possible no matter where you use them. We know there are gaps in the fine-grained PATs implementation that may prevent you from using them everywhere, and we will continue working on fine-grained PATs to unblock your use cases.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Critically, this milestone does not include interactions with the Enterprise object. This means enterprise role management, organization creation, SCIM user management, and enterprise audit logs, among other enterprise APIs, will not be possible with a fine-grained PAT. Supporting enterprise object access with a fine-grained PAT or GitHub App is an ongoing project that will ensure full parity with PATs (Classic) and OAuth apps.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There are also organization- and repository-level gaps that we need to fill, to ensure that every API and every developer workflow is unblocked.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">These items include:</p>\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1746507789\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/790\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/github/roadmap/issues/790/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/790\">#790</a></li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1452071104\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/600\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/github/roadmap/issues/600/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/600\">#600</a></li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1452071151\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/601\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/github/roadmap/issues/601/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/601\">#601</a></li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1373334935\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/558\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/github/roadmap/issues/558/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/558\">#558</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">As we continue to invest in improvements to fine-grained PATs and the modern permissions platform, we hope you'll find more ways to reduce your use of PATs (Classic).</p>",

Developers maintain oversight through transparent edit proposals, ensuring quality and accuracy in the final output.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Expected Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Agent Mode will transform how developers work in their editor by automating broader aspects of the development process. It iterates on its own outputs to complete entire user requests in one go, automatically fixes errors, suggests terminal commands, and assesses run-time errors. This capability will be available for VS Code and later coming to more IDEs, enabling developers to focus on creative aspects rather than tedious coding tasks.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">MCP Server Support (Preview)</h2>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Value Prop</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Stay ahead of the curve with GitHub Copilot and MCP in VS Code. This open standard integration enables your AI assistant to leverage company knowledge bases, proprietary APIs, and specialized tools - creating a personalized coding experience that grows with your needs.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Expected Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration will create a seamless connection between MCP tool servers and GitHub Copilot Chat. Developers will be able to manage multiple MCP servers through an intuitive UI, automatically discover available tools, and invoke them directly through Copilot Chat. This will expand Copilot's capabilities beyond code generation to include specialized tools and resources that enhance the development workflow.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Next Edit Suggestions (NES) GA</h2>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Value Prop</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Stay in your coding flow with Next Edit Suggestions. No more mentally tracking all the places that need updating when you change variable names or refactor classes. Copilot intelligently predicts the logical sequence of edits, allowing you to Tab through suggested changes and maintain perfect focus on the bigger picture of your code architecture.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Expected Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Next Edit Suggestions will extend Copilot's capabilities beyond writing new code to improving the editing experience for existing code. When developers make a change, Copilot will predict subsequent changes needed throughout the project and present them in sequence. This feature will help developers maintain focus on their main tasks by automatically identifying and suggesting edits based on previous changes, accessible with a simple Tab key press.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Codex v2 GA</h2>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Value Prop</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">GitHub Copilot's GPT-4o model accelerates development with faster code completions, reducing latency by up to 60% for seamless collaboration. It supports over 30 programming languages, with expertise in modern frameworks like Next.js and Python, delivering contextually accurate suggestions aligned with contemporary standards. Enhanced contextual awareness enables precise, cohesive completions that respect existing code patterns and project conventions, reducing editing needs while improving code quality. This combination boosts productivity and streamlines the coding experience for developers.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Expected Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The improved AI model behind GitHub Copilot will deliver faster code suggestions with a 13% latency improvement over the previous OpenAI Codex model. Enhanced contextual filtering will take into account a wider range of developer context and usage patterns, resulting in a 6% relative improvement in code acceptance rate.
