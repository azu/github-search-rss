Enterprises have been asking for actions that follow standards (e.g: CodeQL, timely dependency updates, etc.).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">When this work is complete, we will automatically run checks on repositories hosting published Actions to determine if the repository where the Action is hosted follows security best practices. We use a subset of OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation) scorecard checks to make this determination and publish that metadata as part of the Action listing page and details.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We are building this to continue our credibility with customers that GitHub is serious about security. With 17K actions on the Marketplace and more getting added every day, it's imperative that we surface the necessary metadata for  consumers to be able to make decisions about what actions they can rely on.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Whenever there's a state change in a repository (based on certain rules) a dynamic workflow is kicked off to run the checks. The results from the scoring are then surfaced on to the listing page. Since it's a new change, once we go GA, we will give action creators a grace period to make any desired changes, after which the results will be automatically published to the listing details page. New actions authored and published after the GA date will automatically get graded.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">These checks against a repository that's hosting the action will evaluate holistic security practices, source risk assessment and build risk assessment.</p>",

However, organizations don't want to maintain their custom starter workflows in a public repository. Now, org admins have control to choose their own repository(s) (public/private/internal) in the organization to store their custom starter workflows. Any workflow stored in starter-workflows folder in the chosen repositories will be shown as a org suggested starter workflows for the developer.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">And we are also enhancing the new workflow experience in the repository. You will see a dedicated page for showing organization starter workflows.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Org admins can choose specific repositories (public, private, internal) of their choice to maintain their custom starter workflows. Developers can see the org suggested starter workflows when they try to create a new workflow.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Org admin configures the set of repositories to use for storing starter workflows.</li>\n<li>Team members can contribute and store the starter workflows in the starter-workflows folder in the chosen repositories.</li>\n<li>The visibility of the repository decides in what repositories the starter workflow shows up as a suggestion.</li>\n<li>When a developer clicks on new workflow in a repository, he/she can see the org suggested starter workflows in a separate section.</li>\n</ul>",

On the coverage view, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>See counts and percentages of repositories with GitHub security features enabled or disabled, which update when you apply filters</li>\n<li>Track enablement for additional security features, including secret scanning push protection, Dependabot security updates, and code scanning pull request alerts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 dir=\"auto\">Risk view</h4>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The coverage view will be complimented by a new risk view that gives visibility into all alerts across your enterprise's repositories. On the risk view, you can:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>See counts and percentages of repositories with security vulnerabilities, which also update when you apply filters</li>\n<li>See open alerts segmented by severity for both Dependabot and code scanning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Intended Outcome</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Enterprises with multiple organizations face a significant challenge in managing security alerts and ensuring comprehensive security coverage at scale. Security leaders often resort to manually copying and pasting organization-level data and aggregating in a spreadsheet to analyze security for the entire enterprise. This process adds to the workload of security managers and results in inconsistent oversight.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The enterprise-level risk and coverage pages aim to address this challenge by providing a solution that allows enterprises to view security alerts and coverage across all organizations with ease. With this feature, enterprises can eliminate the need for manual consolidation of data and streamline the process, ensuring comprehensive oversight. This will significantly reduce the administrative burden on security managers and enable them to focus on more strategic security initiatives.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">How will it work?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To view the new enterprise-level coverage and risk pages, you will navigate to the \"Code Security\" tab in your enterprise account. Access is limited to enterprise owners, organization owners, and security managers, and data is only visible for organization repositories where you have ownership or security management privileges. Enterprise owners will need to become organization owners to access all associated repositories.</p>",
